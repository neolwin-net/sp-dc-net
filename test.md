# Logical Connection of Submarine Fiber Cables

## Overview
Submarine fiber-optic cables provide international connectivity
between countries by transporting high-capacity optical signals.

## Logical Flow
1. User traffic enters the national ISP backbone
2. Traffic is forwarded to the Cable Landing Station (CLS)
3. Optical transport carries traffic over submarine fiber
4. Traffic exits at the destination country CLS
5. BGP routing determines the onward path

## Key Points
- Submarine cables operate at Layer 1
- Routing decisions are made by BGP at Layer 3
- Multiple countries share the same cable system
